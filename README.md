# 3D Simulation of the Solar System

## Project Description
This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system built as a web application. It provides an interactive and visually appealing representation of the planets and their orbits, allowing users to explore the solar system in a dynamic way.

## Features
- Realistic 3D rendering of the solar system planets and their orbits
- Interactive UI components for navigation and information display
- Responsive design for use on various devices
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Modular React components for easy maintenance and extension

## Technologies Used
- Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
- React for building UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- Various custom UI components and hooks for enhanced user experience
